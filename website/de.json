Für viele Jahre haben uns private Unternehmen wie Google, Facebook, etc. genauso wie staatliche Geheimdienste ausspioniert, um jeden Tag Informationen über uns im Internet zu sammeln. Allerdings sind wir in der Lage, diese Massenspionage zu kontern, indem wir Kryptographie benutzen; allerding erlauben uns zu wenige Projekte, uns ordentlich zu beschützen. Aber heute sind wir glücklich, eine sichere Alternative für unsere Emails zu haben: <span>ProtonMail</span>, welches Ende-zu-Ende-Verschlüsselung erlaubt. Du kannst auch <span>Ring.cx</span> oder <span>Tox.chat</span> beutzen, um deine Unterhaltungen zu verschlüsseln.<br />Davon inspiriert haben wir die Entwicklung von <span>Muonium</span> gestartet, um eine sichere Alternative für das Aufbewahren Deiner Dokumente online zu schaffen. Unsere Richtlinien stehen dafür ein, Deine Daten mit ende-zu-ende zu verschlüsseln, und nur Dich den wahren Besitzer Deiner Daten zu machen.",

But we thought that an additional layer provides more security. After your passphrase, <b>a mail with a code will be sent</b>, you need to enter the received code on the page to be totally logged. All this may be a little long, but strengthens the security of your account.<br />This system is inspired by the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-factor_authentication'>double-authentification</a> made by some sites like Gmail or Facebook."
